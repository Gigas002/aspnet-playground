# aspnet-playground

Learning some stuff I didn't knew. Has a playground for upcoming `net8.0`, therefore, all projects requires `net8.0`.

Asp.net stuff based on [metanit](https://metanit.com/) guides

`net8.0` playground is some shit from [msdn blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/) updates

Also official microsoft learning docs: https://learn.microsoft.com/ru-ru/training/paths/build-web-apps-with-blazor/

And for web api: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api?view=aspnetcore-7.0&tabs=visual-studio-code
