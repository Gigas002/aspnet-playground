# aspnet-playground

Learning some stuff I didn't knew. Has a playground for upcoming `net8.0`, therefore, all projects requires `net8.0`.

Asp.net stuff based on [metanit](https://metanit.com/) guides

`net8.0` playground is some shit from [msdn blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/) updates
